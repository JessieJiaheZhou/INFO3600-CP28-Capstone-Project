1. Introduction

### 1.1 The overall project vision, goal, purpose or objective ###

Within recent years, remote working has been increasingly embraced by the global population [(Welson-Rossman, 2020)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/traceywelsonrossman/2020/04/28/the-implications-of-remote-working-as-the-workplace-of-the-future/#5df995035ed2). However, the recent pandemic and the consequential lockdowns have caused the notion of remote working to become ubiquitous in far more people's lives [(Welson-Rossman, 2020)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/traceywelsonrossman/2020/04/28/the-implications-of-remote-working-as-the-workplace-of-the-future/#5df995035ed2). With no sign of this trend reversing in the long run, remote working has been deemed 'here to stay' by many, with a Gartner survey finding that 74% of CFOs have already reported they intend to shift some of their employees to remote work on a permanent basis [("Gartner CFO Survey", 2020)](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-04-03-gartner-cfo-surey-reveals-74-percent-of-organizations-to-shift-some-employees-to-remote-work-permanently2?source=BLD-200123&utm_medium=social&utm_source=bambu&utm_campaign=SM_GB_YOY_GTR_SOC_BU1_SM-BA-PR).

Paralleling this increasing prevalence of working remotely, we are also developing an ever increasing reliance on video-based conferencing tools such as Zoom, Google Meets and Microsoft Teams [(Wadhwani & Gankar, 2020)]. In fact, the video conferencing market size is predicted to exceed USD 50 billion by 2026 [(Wadhwani & Gankar, 2020)](https://www.gminsights.com/pressrelease/video-conferencing-market). As with the increase we saw in remote working as the COVID-19 pandemic commenced, the demand for videoconferencing also grew exponentially as the pandemic set in. The number video conference mobile app downloads reached 62 million between March 14 and 21, 2020, 90% more than the pre-COVID-19 weekly download average [(Trueman, 2020)](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3535800/pandemic-leads-to-surge-in-video-conferencing-app-downloads.html). Ultimately, these video conference technologies are helping us to achieve some sort of workplace normality whilst not physical in the office. With the help of these video conference technologies, the modern day workplace has evolved and close physical proximity is often no longer a necessity amongst coworkers [(Trueman, 2020)](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3535800/pandemic-leads-to-surge-in-video-conferencing-app-downloads.html).

Despite the promises of encouraging collaboration and productivity among geographically dispersed coworkers, the current video-based conferencing tools still don't offer the same experience as meeting with a colleague in person. Within a conference room setting, we are able to break into groups whilst still being able to glance around and maintain visualisation of what other conversations are going on around the room. That is, we can see who is talking to who, and can easily flit around to these different groups, popping in and sampling the conversations to see what is going on. 

Video conferencing tools do not yet offer us these same liberties. Rather, once in a meeting, we can only see who is in our own meeting. We have no visualisation over other conversations going on in separate meetings, who is a part of these meetings, and have no way to easily move between said meetings. We lose the effortlessness of moving around between conversations that we would normally get in person in social settings, conference rooms, and classrooms. These siloed meeting rooms represent an extreme limitation of the current video-conferencing platforms. 

### 1.2 What the project will achieve ###

This project sets out to combat the pain-points currently experienced in the siloed meetings of current video conferencing platforms. It aims to exploit a web-platform API to create a web-based, video conferencing platform with the look and feel of a real conference floor. This tool should allow users to effortlessly move between conversations occurring on the platform and be in a conversation whilst maintaining visualisation over what other conversations are occurring around them. 

More specifically, the web conferencing platform will be able to support, at a minimum, 10 simultaneous video calls, each able to support at least 5 participants within them. When within one of these video calls, a participant maintains visualisation over who is in each other meeting that is happening at the same time. Each other meeting occurring is listed, along with a visually appealing, low resolution snapshot representing members of that meeting, on the meeting screen of a participant.

Meeting certain benchmarks in terms of performance and usability is also part of the overall goal of the project. For instance, transitioning between meetings effortlessly in less than 3 seconds, with at most 2 clicks is an example of a usability metric which is being considered.

### 1.3 The key stakeholders, what do they do, and how they interact ###

We have categorised our major stakeholders into two categories, external or internal, and outlined their differing levels of power over, and interest in, our project. The primary external stakeholder for this project is Ben Sand, the project manager of our client. Due to the high level of power and interest Ben has in our project, and based on our stakeholder analysis using a power-interest grid we realised that we need to manage his expectations closely. He has the biggest impact on the success of our project and is the major decision maker [(Bdaiwi, 2017)](https://www.projectmanagement.com/wikis/368897/Stakeholder-Analysis--using-the-Power-Interest-Grid). To keep ongoing communications with Ben, we meet with him twice a week, on Mondays and Fridays at 4:10pm and regularly get updates on his most recent requirements for the project. For each meeting, we have an agreed deliverable due and must create a 1 minute progress video to present to him in order to maximise the efficiency of each meeting.

Other external stakeholders identified who have low power and high interest in our project include the Jitsi developers team, our tutor and our end-users as our external stakeholders. Our team team members are also considered high interest, low power internal stakeholders. All these stakeholders need to be considered and informed adequately as they can provide important information and support to the project. An overview of all major stakeholders identified, along with their expectations for the project, has been provided below in form of a stakeholder register.

### 1.4 Identification of resources and risks involved in the project ###

We have classified our resources into three separate categories including human, time and material/equipment resources. 

The human resources available for this project include Ben Sand as our client's project manager who provides us the requirements of the project and assistance upon request on a regular basis, Adhish Panta as our tutor who assists us in terms of the management and administration of tasks of the project, and our team members who cover different XP roles including customer point of contact, manager, tracker, programmer and tester. Team members with a background in different areas of IT including web development, server side development and UI/UX come together to satisfy the combination of skills required for this project. The risk associated with this category of resources is that, although the aforementioned people are each expert in their field, during the process of implementation of the project, issues might arise which will require knowledge in different or more specific areas. An instance of these areas can be the questions that arise which need to be directly asked of developers from the Jitsi/Zoom team who have a more in depth and detailed understanding of their particular system.

Like any other project, time is a crucial resource and a key driver of this project. Identification of hours required for the completion of each task, creating multiple deadlines and milestones based on major due dates for deliverables, and monitoring the time spent on different activities have been crucial for maintaining proper management of this vital and limited resource. Poor management of time would result in missing targets, wasting human and material resources and the reduction in the quality of work being delivered to the client. Therefore, these risks need to be considered throughout the whole process of this project [(Atkinson, 1999)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0263786398000696).

In this project we have been using tools including Bitbucket and SourceTree as our source code management system, Jira as our issue tracker, USYD library website as our academic resource provider, Visual Studio Code as our code editor, Jest as our JS unit testing framework, Termius and PuTTy terminals, AWS route 53 as our domain registry, vultr as our server service provider and Jitsi open-source projects as our base code. Having limited knowledge in terms of the actual functionality and having access to a limited number of supporting documentation for the platforms mentioned previously, is considered a risk associated with this category of resources.

#  Overview of system from user view (user stories) 

### 2.1 User ###

It is critical for designers and developer to have a clear view of what operations should be able to be performed by the users, what activities they need to do to complete each operation, and what might happen to both of the manipulator and the people participating the meeting.

We will use Green Yellow Red (GYR) to represent the current construction status of corresponding operation of user. "G" means that we have included that functionality in the latest version of development; "Y" means that we have partially achieved the goal of that operation, but are still working on enabling all of the functionalities; and "R" means that this part is in plans for development, but has not been started yet. 

Please note, we tried to fit the text content into wiki, but its format is not friendly to present a table with pictures so we were forced to use screen shots instead. If you would like to see the original version of this table, feel free to look at the original excel sheet [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wTZhAU1kdcuON4ebaLl95kqE7yp2OyOh/view?usp=sharing).

### 2.2 Host ###

We want our web conference to be a quickly running, easy to hop-on hop-off, installation free application. In that way, the host can be any participant in the meeting and have mostly the same access level as general users.  But since we employ Jitsi API as our conferencing base architecture, the host of a meeting should have the following features and privileges:

1. If a user joins a meeting with no other participants, the user will be assigned as the host of the meeting.
2. The host will be able to modify the meeting security settings, including: enable/disable lobby mode; require a password from future participants to join the meeting
3. The host can start live streaming without asking others for permission, but when a participant clicks the start streaming button, they will be alerted that they need host’s permission to complete the operation
4. The host can start screen recording without asking others for approval, but when participant clicks the start recording button, they will be alerted that they need host’s permission to complete the operation
5. The host can mute all users anytime during the meeting, and before users join in the session
6. When the host leaves the meeting, he or she will be asked to grant moderator to another participant
